  <h2>“A grateful mind is a great mind which eventually attracts to itself great things.” – Plato</h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    As I journey onward—continually learning, researching, and teaching—I remain deeply thankful for the people whose guidance, friendship, and encouragement have shaped my path. This page honours those who’ve inspired me, believed in me, and helped me grow.

  <h3>Family &amp; Early Support</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    My rock-solid foundation begins at home. To <strong>Mom</strong>, <strong>Dad</strong>, my <strong>brother</strong>, <strong>sister-in-law</strong>, <strong>sister</strong>, and all my <strong>uncles</strong>, <strong>aunts</strong>, and <strong>cousins</strong>—thank you for unwavering love, late-night discussions, and believing in every dream, however grand.
  </p>

  <h3>School Years</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Special gratitude to <strong>Mr Hitesh Vaishnav</strong>, whose encouragement first ignited my curiosity in mathematics. To my secondary school maths teachers—<strong>Mr Urvish Vyas</strong>, <strong>Mr P S Patel</strong>, <strong>Mr Naresh Patel</strong>, <strong>Mr Vipul Patel</strong>, and <strong>Ms Meera Wadhwa</strong>—your lessons went far beyond equations, teaching me resilience and critical thinking. And to <strong>Dr Ekta Shah</strong> (“Ekta didi”), for patiently guiding my earliest questions in astrophysics and academia.

  <h3>Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU)</h3>

    At PDEU, I found mentors and friends who became like family. <strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ritu-Sahni-6">Dr Ritu Sahni</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://orsp.pdpu.ac.in/adminfacviewprofile.aspx?facid=manoj.sahni">Dr Manoj Sahni</a></strong>, thank you for transforming from module instructors into research guides and second parents. <strong><a href="https://orsp.pdpu.ac.in/adminfacviewprofile.aspx?facid=nigam.dave">Dr Nigam Dave</a></strong>, our “Dumbledore of SLS,” for making every student feel safe and welcome. <strong>Ms Nairuti Trivedi</strong>, our counsellor, for listening to even my most far-fetched theories and helping me refocus. To cohort buddies <strong><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dushyant-dave-88203312">Dushyant Dave</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/manali-shah-b7262826a">Manali Shah</a></strong>, and the entire <a href="https://sls.pdpu.ac.in/">SLS admin team</a>—your practical advice saw me through every academic hurdle. And to <strong><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/pooja-ajmera-shah-1987b296">Mrs Pooja Ajmera Shah</a></strong> and the OSAIL, OIR, and Exam Cell teams—thank you for deftly navigating bureaucracy on my behalf.

  <h3>Imperial College London</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    My time at Imperial was defined by inspiring mentors: <strong><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/about-us/people/academic-and-research-staff/">Prof Pierre M Germain</a></strong>, who rekindled my passion for mathematical physics; <strong><a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.pruessner">Dr Gunnar Pruessner</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/c.ford">Dr Christopher Ford</a></strong>, who guided my module selections with wisdom; <strong><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.crowdy">Prof Darren Crowdy</a></strong>, who revealed the elegance of vortex dynamics; and <strong><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/samuel.brzezicki10">Dr Samuel Brzezicki</a></strong>, whose supervision led my MSc thesis to distinction. Thanks also to <strong><a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.pruessner">Prof Igor Shevchenko</a></strong> for open-minded discussions and to <strong><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/undergraduate-administration-contacts/">Ms Sai Nathan</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/undergraduate-administration-contacts/">Mr Ahmed Aynan</a></strong> for seamless administrative support throughout my programme.

  <h3>Community &amp; Friends</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Beyond academia, my “buddies” have been a constant source of joy and perspective:
  </p>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li><strong>School &amp; Hometown:</strong> Satish, Yesha, Devang, Dhrumil, Yash, Vivek</li>
    <li><strong>SXCA &amp; PDEU:</strong> Siddharth, Zarmina, Mariya, Vanditha, Jaykit, Harsh, Kunal, Happy, Yagn</li>
    <li><strong>ICL &amp; London:</strong> Shagun, Samir, Lea, Elliot, Ilyass, Edward, Yuan</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Your camaraderie reminds me that learning is as much about shared laughter and late-night coffee as it is about equations and experiments.
