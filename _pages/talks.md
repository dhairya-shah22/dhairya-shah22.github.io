<p>Engaging diverse audiences has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my academic journey. Below are highlights of my public talks and outreach roles, showcasing how I’ve inspired students, fostered scientific curiosity, and adapted to challenges like the pandemic. For invitations or suggestions, please <a href="mailto:contact@drshah.me">get in touch</a>.</p>

## Bilimora College, SGVNM University, India  
**Guest Speaker**  
**Dates:** 17 January 2019 &amp; 29 June 2019  

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
I delivered interactive lectures on research opportunities in science and mathematics to tribal undergraduate students. By blending real-world examples with fundamental concepts, I aimed to ignite curiosity and demonstrate the relevance of natural sciences. Feedback from faculty indicated a subsequent 10–15% increase in MSc applications, underscoring the sessions’ impact.

## Brahmand – The Astronomy Club, PDEU  
**President**  
**July 2019 – June 2020**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
As president of Brahmand, I led a team of 42 members to organise 13 events—ranging from telescope-making workshops to advanced technical seminars—that enriched the campus community’s engagement with astronomy. When COVID restrictions hit, I spearheaded the development and launch of our club website, ensuring uninterrupted communication and virtual participation.

**Technical Team Member**  
**September 2017 – June 2019**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
In this foundational role, I supported the design and delivery of astronomy sessions, helping curate content and demos that deepened members’ understanding of planetary science, observational techniques, and astrophysics theory.

## Dinsha Patel Planetarium, Nadiad, India  
**Docent**  
**August 2016 – June 2017**  

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
At 16, I volunteered as a planetarium docent, guiding visitors through exhibits and narrating the significance of celestial imagery. This role developed my skills in communicating complex astronomical concepts to lay audiences, laying the groundwork for my lifelong passion in science outreach.
