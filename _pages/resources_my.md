<p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve built a personal library of materials—from lecture notes and LaTeX templates to interactive Manim animations—that reflect the skills and techniques I’ve honed over the years. I’ll update this page regularly as I create new modules, code snippets, and projects.</p>

### LaTeX Resources

- **🏷 A Simple CV Template**  
  A minimalist, easy-to-customise LaTeX CV template I developed for my own academic résumé, designed to be clean, semantic, and ready for adaptation.  
  - **Repo:** [GitHub: CV_Template](https://github.com/dhairya-shah22/dhairya-shah22.github.io/tree/master/CV_Template)  
  - **PDF Demo:** [Academic CV Sample](https://drshah.me/files/Academic_CV_Sample.pdf)

<!-- 
Future sections to add:
### Lecture Notes
- Module-specific notes and problem sheets (Part II General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, etc.)

### Manim Projects
- Interactive animations and tutorials illustrating key physics concepts

### Code Repositories
- Numerical methods, visualisations, and research scripts hosted on GitHub
