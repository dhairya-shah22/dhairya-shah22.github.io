## Theses

- **Postgraduate Thesis**  
  [Local Solution to Electro-Capillary Phenomenon near Sharp Corner](https://drive.proton.me/urls/FARC4Q83PG#XnzkI6L6YDPG)  
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Investigates the voltage behaviour near the triple contact point in electrowetting, deriving eigenvalue conditions that demonstrate the absence of Moffatt‐type eddies—insights critical to the design of electrowetting-based devices.
  </div>

- **Undergraduate Thesis**  
  [On Numerical Methods for Real Solutions of One Variable Nonlinear Equations](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QSWRXSJ8Y0#vcWKqnAsobnF)  
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    A detailed survey and classification of iterative schemes leading to the development of three novel cubic‐convergent methods for solving one‐variable nonlinear equations, culminating in a hypothesis that fixed‐point families offer optimal stability and efficiency.
