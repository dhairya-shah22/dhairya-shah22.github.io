## Resources
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
Welcome to the Resources section! Here, you'll find valuable materials and tools carefully curated to aid your academic journey. As an ardent supporter of free learning, most of the resources I have listed on this page will provid freely available material, be it Free/Public Domain Books or Open Access / Pre-print Articles or Free/Libre Open Source Softwares (FLOSS).
