## Personalised Resources

This section is based on my experience and preparation.

### Mathematics
- Cambridge Tripos notes:
In my humble opinion, the Cambridge Tripos provides standardised sets of notes, example sheets, and exam papers. Anyone who thoroughly studies and practices them will have covered fundamentals to pursue {Pure or Applied} Mathematics MSc and PhDs. Many professors and students there have compiled their versions of notes, further enriching the available resources. A simple [internet](https://duckduckgo.com/) search like [Cambridge Part II General Relativity Notes](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=Cambridge+Part+II+General+Relativity+Notes&ia=web) will provide you module-specific notes. Nonetheless, here are some notes:
  1. [Official Website](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/studentreps/tripos-specific-resources) 
  2. [Dr. Dexter Chua](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/) 
  3. [Mr David Bai](https://zb260.user.srcf.net/notes/)
  4. [Sky Wilshaw](https://thirdsgames.co.uk/maths.html)

## My Humble Resources

I'm planning to put together a collection of resources that reflect what I've learned during my academic journey. This will include notes from my modules, LaTeX resources, codes, Manim projects, and more. I'll be updating this section gradually as I add new resources.
