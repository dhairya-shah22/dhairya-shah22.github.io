**_Hello! Welcome to my digital abode._**

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am Dhairya Shah, a Mathematics enthusiast, an inquisitive, curious and questioning child at heart and a graduate in MSc in Applied Mathematics from Imperial College London, UK.
</div>

## Academic Excellence
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
My educational odyssey began in Gandhinagar, Gujarat in India, studying a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Mathematics along with conducting research, with a Diploma in Liberal Studies. During my tenure, not only did I perform well academically but also emerged as a leader in various social and academic arenas, bringing accolades to my university, PDEU from time to time.

## Teaching and Research
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
With over three years experience in teaching Mathematics at the undergraduate level, I blend my knowledge with an engaging teaching style, attempt at inspiring the next generation of STEM students. To that effect, my research portfolio includes  over five Scopus, ESCI and SCIE indexed research papers which introduced theories in Mathematical sciences.

## A Cosmic Journey  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond the classroom, my passion lies in exploring the vastness in the realms of physics and cosmology. I have a deep fascination with reimagining fundamental principles like gravity from unexplored perspectives; my thirst is to gain deeper understanding into the theories of cosmology. Well, my interest in cosmology has been a lifelong pursuit (life = 2/3 of my current existence LOL). My dream is to contribute to the current research in the scientific fields of mathematics and theoretical physics.

## A Vision for the Future 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
At the heart of my all my young ambitions, lies a vision, an aim â€“ to leverage, explore and utilise my learning in physical sciences to make our world more inclusive, safer and impactful place to live in as one big happy family.
</div>

## Join me in my Journey 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Come along and explore the world from the eyes of a young, emerging researcher, and discover more about the projects, research, and the journey in the fascinating world of mathematics and theoretical physics.
