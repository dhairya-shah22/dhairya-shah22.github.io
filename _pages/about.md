  Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetimes:
  Energy Conditions & Quantum Energy Inequalities
---  
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
Welcome — I'm Dhairya. From a planetarium docent in rural India to defending my MSc thesis in the same lecture hall where I first presented a paper at 17, my journey has been guided by curiosity and a passion for uncovering nature’s hidden patterns.
</div>

## My Academic Odyssey  
- **Pandit Deendayal Energy University** (BSc, Mathematics & Liberal Studies): Graduated with a CPI of 9.10/10 while pioneering research in fixed-point theory, fuzzy-set theory, and series of floor & ceiling functions. Maintained an unbroken record of perfect scores (10/10) in all mathematics modules across eight semesters.
- **Imperial College London** (MSc, Applied Mathematics): Awarded Distinction; Explored electro-capillary phenomena and vortex dynamics under the guidance of Dr. Samuel Brzezicki.

## Teaching & Past Research  
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
I’ve taught over 200 STEM students—from SEN learners at The Charter School North Dulwich to international cohorts at PDEU—by combining storytelling, real-world examples, and rigorous problem-solving. Some of my work has been published in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics">MDPI Mathematics</a> and in Springer conference proceedings. My research explores how core mathematical models behave under varied physical conditions.

## Research Aim and Focus  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
My current passion is Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetimes—examining energy conditions and quantum energy inequalities at singularities. I aim to connect mathematical rigor with physical insight, seeking small quantum “ripples” that reshape our understanding of gravity.
</div>

## Vision & Impact  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I envision a world where deep theoretical insights guide technology for sustainability and inclusivity. By marrying abstract mathematics with physics, I aim to develop models that inform everything from climate simulations to equitable resource distribution.
