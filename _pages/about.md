**_Welcome to the digital abode of Dhairya Shah; your host!_**

An illustrious alumnus of Imperial College London, I graduated with distinction in Applied Mathematics. My academic journey is a testament towards my dedication and passion for mathematics and physics.

## Academic Excellence

My educational odyssey began in Gandhinagar, Gujarat in India, where I studied Bachelor of Science in Mathematics along with research, a four-year full-time degree with a Diploma in Liberal Arts. During my tenure, not only did I excel academically but also emerged as a dynamic leader in various social and academic arenas, bringing accolades to my university, PDEU.

## Teaching and Research

With over two years experience in teaching Mathematics at the undergraduate level, I blend my knowledge with an engaging teaching style, inspiring the next generation of STEM students. I have, to my credit, over five Scopus, ESCI and SCIE indexed research papers where I introduced ingenious theories in Mathematical sciences. 

## A Cosmic Journey in Physics  
Beyond the classroom, I immerse myself in the realms of physics and cosmology. My fascination with reimagining fundamental principles like gravity from unique perspectives is not just a pastime; it is a passionate quest for deeper understanding into the theories of cosmology. A voracious reader and avid learner, my interest in cosmology has been a lifelong pursuit (life = 2/3 of my current existence LOL). My dream is to contribute significantly to the scientific fields of mathematics and theoretical physics. 

## A Vision for the Future 
At the heart of my ambitions lies a goal â€“ to utilize my expertise in maths and physics to make our world more meaningful and impactful for the upcoming generations.
