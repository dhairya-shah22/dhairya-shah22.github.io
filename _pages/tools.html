<h2>Crucial Digital Tools</h2>

<p>These Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) (or their free or freemium options) will help you seamlessly navigate the worldwide web. They offer minimal digital tracking, enhanced security, and ensure ethical software usage without resorting to piracy.</p>

<h3>Operating Systems (Linux):</h3>

<p>Heeding experts' advice, I shifted to Linux which has helped me immensely. Many things in my system are now automated, battery life has significantly increased. I have more storage due to Linux's minimalism. Moreover, my system never hangs abruptly, and the updates are smooth - no irritating blue screens. Unlike the famous OS, in Linux, I can freely encrypt files and directories (even the whole system), which gives me actual control over my material. Any average user can shift to Linux from their current OS. I find the following most beginner-friendly and easy to switch:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Further, in Fedora, there is <a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Labs</a>, a collection of pre-configured bundles with Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) tailored for specific purposes. For enthusiastic learners, here are some example suites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/astronomy/">Astronomy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro/">Computational Neuroscience</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/jam/">Music</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/robotics/">Robotics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools:</h3>

<p>There are many tools that many FOSS advocates would suggest. Here are my recommendations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Office Suite:</strong><br>
  Instead of looking for pirated office software, you can use Free (FOSS) alternatives to make spreadsheets, presentations, word processing (writing theses, CVs, articles, etc.). Plus, these software are secure, don't track you, or keep nagging you for payments.
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> - Writer for Word Processing, Calc for Spreadsheets, Impress for presentations, etc.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-docs.aspx?from=office-suite#docs-community">OnlyOffice - Community</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Text Processing and Presentation Program:</strong><br>
  <strong>LaTeX</strong> is far superior to anything you may have been using thus far. It gives unparalleled stability and exceptional smoothness. Unlike the famous proprietary alternative, LaTeX content and pages don't go crazy and abruptly change position when adding or modifying images or tables. Another advantage for academics is that you will never have to manually write a table of content or use external software. My <a href="https://drshah.me/files/Academic_CV.pdf">CV</a>, theses (<a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/QSWRXSJ8Y0#vcWKqnAsobnF">UG</a> and <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/FARC4Q83PG#XnzkI6L6YDPG">PG</a>), as well as corresponding presentations (<a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/W2DHVV9W48#nWIkRYocnhvy">UG</a>, <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/QTKT0BSPN8#I5w2tU3TYxcI">PG</a>, and <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/SCY2FG16FW#ELI9rINchSTK">PG Poster</a>), were all written in <strong>LaTeX</strong>.

    <li>Distributions:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">Tex Live</a> for Linux</li>
        <li><a href="https://miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a> for Windows</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Integrated Writing Environment:
      <ul>

        <li><a href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">TexMaker</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>File Versioning:</strong><br>
  Thesis1.pdf, Thesis_Final.pdf, Final_Final.pdf, Final_Final2.pdf. Does it seem relatable? Use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for file versioning. Keep the same file name, work on the file easily, and go back to older versions of your file when required. With Git, I personally use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. One of the only a few proprietary products that I use. Git (or its alternatives) alongside GitHub (or its FOSS alternatives) are extremely helpful in collaboration, file, and code sharing. This website is published thanks to one such collaboration.

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Email, Calendar, Cloud (Drive):</strong><br>
  <a href="https://proton.me/">Proton</a>. Your email, calendar, and cloud service providers do not encrypt your material by default, infringing your privacy. As Proton describes itself best - "Proton was born in Switzerland in 2014 when a team of scientists who met at CERN decided to build a better internet where privacy is the default." Despite not being entirely open-source, Proton is widely respected and utilized in the privacy community as well as routinely audited, building trust.
   <ul>
    <li>Alternatives:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://disroot.org">Disroot</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong><br>
  Never use the same password or 8-character passwords. Rather, build a habit of using FOSS password managers.
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> for Android, Linux, Windows, MacOS, iPhone, as well as a browser plugin.</li>
    <li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/pricing/">Bitwarden</a> for Browser plugin</li>
    <li><a href="https://proton.me/pass/">ProtonPass</a> Since browser plugin and Apps. For now, apps are available on Windows, Android, and iOS.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
