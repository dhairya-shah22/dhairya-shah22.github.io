### Mathematics
- Cambridge Tripos notes:

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
In my humble opinion, the Cambridge Tripos is the most prestigious Mathematics program. The university provides standardised sets of notes, example sheets, and exam papers. Anyone who thoroughly studies and comprehends the notes and practices the example sheets and exam papers, will have covered fundamentals to easily pursue {Pure or Applied} Mathematics MSc and PhDs. Add a thorough study and practice of part III modules to this preparation and your are well prepared for a direct PhD. Many professors and students at Cambridge have compiled their versions of notes, further enriching the available resources. A simple [internet](https://duckduckgo.com/) search like [Cambridge Part II General Relativity Notes](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=Cambridge+Part+II+General+Relativity+Notes&ia=web) will provide you module-specific notes. Nonetheless, here are some notes which I personally used at some point:

  2. [Dr. Dexter Chua](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/) 
  3. [Mr David Bai](https://zb260.user.srcf.net/notes/)
