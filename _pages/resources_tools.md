<p>As a proponent of ethical and secure computing, I rely on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) tools (and their free/freemium counterparts) that prioritize privacy, performance, and user control. Below is my curated toolkit to help you build a robust, secure, and efficient digital environment—no piracy needed.</p>

## 🐧 Operating Systems

### 🔄 Linux Distributions  
Switching to Linux has unlocked greater stability, automation, and battery life on my machines—all with zero cost and full encryption control. Here are the most beginner-friendly distros I recommend:

- **[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)** — Known for its intuitive desktop and Windows-like familiarity, making the transition seamless.  
- **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)** — A cutting-edge distro with rapid release cycles and a vibrant community; explore specialized bundles via [Fedora Labs](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/).  
- **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)** — The rock-solid foundation behind many distros (including Mint and Ubuntu), renowned for its stability and extensive package repository.

## 💼 Productivity Suites

### 📊 Office & Spreadsheets  
Why pay for proprietary suites when FOSS alternatives cover all your needs?

- **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)** — A fully featured office suite (Writer, Calc, Impress, etc.) that’s compatible with Microsoft formats and backed by a large community.  
- **[ONLYOFFICE Docs Community](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-community.aspx)** — A modern, web-based editor with robust collaboration features, released under the AGPL v3 license.

## 📝 Writing & Typesetting

### ✒️ LaTeX  
For professional-grade documents—theses, articles, slides—LaTeX is unparalleled in handling complex mathematics, consistent formatting, and automated references.  

- **Distributions**:  
  - [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (cross-platform)  
  - [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)  
- **Editors**:  
  - [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)  
  - [TeXmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)  

## 🛠 Version Control

### 🔄 Git & Alternatives  
Ditch ad-hoc filenames like `Thesis_Final2.pdf`—use version control to track changes, branch experiments, and collaborate seamlessly.  

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** — The industry-standard, distributed VCS, optimized for speed and flexibility.  
- **Alternatives**:  
  - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)  
  - [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)  
- **Hosting**:  
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/) (proprietary, generous free tier)  
  - FOSS alternatives: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), [Gitea](https://gitea.com/), [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/).

## 📧 Communication & Cloud

### 🔐 Secure Email & Storage  
Your data should be yours alone. Proton’s end-to-end encryption ensures that no one—but you—can read your messages or files.  

- **[Proton](https://proton.me/)** — Email, calendar, and cloud storage with zero-access encryption and Swiss privacy protections.  
- **Alternatives**: [Disroot](https://disroot.org/), [Tuta](https://tuta.com/).

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### 🔑 Password Managers  
Never reuse passwords—secure all accounts with a FOSS password manager.  

- **[KeePass](https://keepass.info/)** — Lightweight, AES-256 and ChaCha20 encryption, cross-platform support via plugins.  
- **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/open-source/)** — Fully open-source, zero-knowledge architecture, audited by third parties.
