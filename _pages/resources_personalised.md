<p>Drawing on my own learning path—from rigorous Cambridge Tripos study to intimate lectures in theoretical physics—this collection shares the exact notes, problem sheets, and video series that propelled my growth. Each resource reflects my commitment to deep conceptual understanding and self-directed, accelerated learning.</p>

## Mathematics

### Cambridge Tripos Notes  
The Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is widely regarded as one of the most challenging and prestigious undergraduate mathematics programs in the world. The Faculty of Mathematics collates both official and high-quality unofficial lecture notes, example sheets, and past exam papers to cover the core Parts IA–II curriculum .  

1. **[Official Tripos Resources](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/studentreps/tripos-specific-resources)** — Central repository of past exam papers and lecture notes, maintained by the student representatives .  
2. **[Dexter Chua’s Notes](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/)** — Detailed Part IA–IB lecture summaries and problem sets, invaluable for mastering analysis and linear algebra.  
3. **[David Bai’s Collection](https://zb260.user.srcf.net/notes/)** — Curated Part II lecture notes emphasizing geometry and complex analysis.  
4. **[Thirds’ Archimedeans Notes](https://thirdsgames.co.uk/maths.html)** — A student-driven archive of worksheets, ideal for reinforcing problem-solving techniques.  
5. **[“Really Old Notes” via Archimedeans Website](https://kkk25.user.srcf.net/notes.php)** — Historical lecture transcriptions offering alternate notational insights.  

## Physics

### Cambridge Physics Tripos (David Tong)  
Professor David Tong’s lecture notes at DAMTP (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics) span core and advanced topics—from classical mechanics to quantum field theory—geared toward both final-year undergraduates and Part III master’s students.  

1. **[Lectures on Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html)** — Comprehensive coverage of mechanics, electromagnetism, and statistical physics.  
2. **[Quantum Field Theory Notes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html)** — A full Part III QFT syllabus with downloadable PDFs and video links.  
3. **[Gauge Theory Lectures](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/gaugetheory.html)** — In-depth treatment of non-Abelian gauge fields, essential for modern theoretical research.  

*Note:* Tong’s materials emphasize mathematical rigor—if you prefer a more intuitive, geometry-first approach, consider supplementing with the Susskind series below.

### Stanford “Theoretical Minimum” (Leonard Susskind)  
Leonard Susskind’s **Theoretical Minimum** lectures and books distill the essential physics concepts with intuitive explanations and worked examples, making them ideal for building physical insight alongside the Cambridge notes.  

1. **[Stanford Physics Lectures Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6i60qoDQhQGaGbbg-4aSwXJvxOqO6o5e)** — A single consolidated playlist of all core courses (Classical Mechanics, Special Relativity, etc.).  
2. **[“Theoretical Minimum” on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theoretical_Minimum)** — Overview of the six-part lecture series and its companion textbooks.
