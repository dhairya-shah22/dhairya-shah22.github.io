### Crucial Digital Tools

These Free and Open-Source Softwares (FOSS) (or their free or freemium options) will help you seamlessly navigate through world-wide-web. They offer minimal digital tracking, enhahnced security, and ensure ethical software usage without resorting to piracy.

#### Operating Systems (Linux):

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
Heeding experts' advice, I shifted to Linux which has helped me immensely. Many things in my system are now automated, battery life has significantly increased. I have more storage due to the Linux's minimalism. Moreover, my system never hangs abruptly and the updates are smooth - no irritating blue screens. Unlike the famous OS, in linux I can freely encrypt files and directories (even the whole system) which gives me actual control over my material. Any average user can shift to linux from their current OS. I find following the most beginner friendly and easy to switch:
</div>

  1. [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
  2. [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
  3. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
Further, In Fedora there is [Fedora-Labs](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/), a collection pre-configured bundles with Free and Open-Source Softwares (FOSS) to tailored for specific purposes. For enthusiastic learners here are some example suites:

    2.1. [Astronomy](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/astronomy/)
    2.2. [Computational Neuroscience](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro/)
    2.3. [Music](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/jam/)
    2.4. [Robotics](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/robotics/)
#### Tools:
This section is really tricky. There are lot many tools which many FOSS advocates would suggest. Here are my recommendations:

  1. **Office Suite:** Instead of looking for pirated office (Never use or trust pirated resources and softwares), you can use Free (FOSS) alternatives to make spreadsheets, presentations, word processing (Writing theses, CV, articles etc). Plus, these softwares are secure, don't track you or keep on nagging you for payments.
    1.1. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Writer for Word Processing, Calc for Spreadsheets, Impress for presentations, etc.
    1.2. [OnlyOffice - COmmunity](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-docs.aspx?from=office-suite#docs-community)
  
  2. <div style="text-align: justify;"> 
  **Text processing and Presentation program:** (**\LaTeX**)[https://www.latex-project.org/] is far superior to anything you may have been using thus far. It gives unparallel stability and exceptional smoothness. Unlike the famous proprietary alernative, **\LaTeX** content and pages don't go crazy and abruptly change position when adding or modifying images or tables. Another advantage for academics is that you will never have to manually write table of content or use external softwares. My [CV](https://drshah.me/files/Academic_CV.pdf), theses ([UG](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QSWRXSJ8Y0#vcWKqnAsobnF) and [PG](https://drive.proton.me/urls/FARC4Q83PG#XnzkI6L6YDPG)) as well as corresponding presentations ([UG](https://drive.proton.me/urls/W2DHVV9W48#nWIkRYocnhvy), [PG](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QTKT0BSPN8#I5w2tU3TYxcI) and [PG Poster](https://drive.proton.me/urls/SCY2FG16FW#ELI9rINchSTK)) were all written in **\LaTeX**.
  </div>
    - Distributions:
    2.1.1. [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux
    2.1.2. [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows

    - Integrated Writing Environment:
    2.2.1. [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
    2.2.2. [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

  3. <div style="text-align: justify;"> 
  **File Versioning:** Thesis1.pdf, Thesis_Final.pdf, Final_Final.pdf, Final_Final2.pdf. Does it seem relatable? Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for file versioning. Keep the same file name, work on the file easily annd back to the older versions of your file when required. With Git I personally use [GitHub](https://github.com/). One of the only few proprietary products that I use. Git (or its alternatives) alongside GitHub (or its FOSS alternatives) are extremely helpful in collaboration, file and code sharing. This website is published thanks to one such collaboration.

    - Git Alternatives:
    3.1.1. [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
    3.1.2. [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)
    
    - GitHub Alternatives: 
    3.2.1. [Codeberg](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/first-steps/)
    3.2.2. [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)
    3.2.3. [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/products/gitea/)
    
  4. <div style="text-align: justify;">
  **Email, Calendar, Cloud (Drive):** [Proton](https://proton.me/). Your email, calendar and cloud service providers do not encrypt your material by default, infringing your privacy. As proton describes itself best - "Proton was born in Switzerland in 2014 when a team of scientists who met at CERN decided to build a better internet where privacy is the default". Despite not bein entiely open-source, Proton is widely respected and utilised in privacy community as well as routinely audited building trust.

  - Alternatives:
    4.1. [Disroot](https://disroot.org)
    4.2. [Tuta](https://tuta.com/)
    
  </div>

  5. **Password Managers:** Never use the same password or 8-character passwords. Rather, build a habit of using FOSS password managers.
    
    5.1 [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) for Android, Linux, Windows, MacOS, iPhone as well as Browser plugin.
    5.2 [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/) for Browser plugin
    5.3 [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/pass/) Sinced browser plugin and Apps. For now, apps are available on Windows, Android and iOS.
