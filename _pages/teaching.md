<p>My teaching roles—from small-group tutoring to specialised undergraduate seminars—are grounded in evidence-based practices proven to boost learning outcomes and foster inclusivity. Small-group tuition can accelerate progress by an average of four months per year when targeted to specific needs and inclusive, Universal Design for Learning strategies enhance engagement and achievement for SEN pupils.</p>

## TeamUp (SYLA), London  
**Volunteer Tutor (KS2–KS4 Mathematics)**  
*November 2024 – February 2025*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
I delivered structured small-group sessions covering five core KS3 topics, combining interactive instruction with diagnostic assessment to adapt lessons. Such targeted small-group tuition has been shown to yield three to four months’ additional progress over a year, especially when led by trained tutors.

## The Charter School North Dulwich, London  
**Maths Graduate Teaching Assistant (SEN & Mathematics)**  
*September 2024 – Present*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
As a Maths Graduate TA, I implement multi-sensory and scaffolded tasks—key UDL approaches—to support pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Research indicates these high-quality teaching strategies significantly improve SEN students’ engagement and attainment in mathematics. I also designed problem-solving workshops for Year 7 preparation for the UKMT Junior Mathematical Olympiad.

## Cardinal Hume Centre, London  
**Homework Club Volunteer (Mathematics & Science)**  
*May 2024 – Present*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
Homework clubs foster school belonging and peer support, which correlate with higher academic performance and well-being. I facilitate one-to-one and small-group sessions in geometry and probability up to GCSE level, integrating literacy and numeracy skill-building to boost confidence and independent learning.

## Mathematics & Astronomy Clubs, PDEU  
**Course Facilitator: Mathematical Aspects of Relativity**  
*October 2023 – December 2023*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
I designed and led a 30-hour seminar on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, culminating in derivations like \(E=mc^2\). Seminar-style, interactive physics courses deepen conceptual understanding far beyond traditional lectures, and students reported increased confidence tackling advanced topics.

## Office of International Relations, PDEU  
**Course Facilitator & Teacher: Foundations of Mathematics**  
*December 2019 – March 2020*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
For twelve international engineering students, I crafted a foundations module emphasising logical reasoning, set theory, and proof techniques. Foundational mathematics courses that strengthen reasoning skills substantially improve students’ readiness for advanced STEM study.

## Yusuf Mehrally Centre (NGO), Kutch  
**Teacher of Science & Mathematics**  
*December 2018 – January 2019*  

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
At an under-resourced centre, I delivered contextualised, collaborative lessons in mathematics and science to 8th-grade pupils. Targeted instructional programmes for disadvantaged students can narrow achievement gaps and boost exam performance without extra funding.
