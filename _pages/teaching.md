## Teaching Experience

### Mathematics and Astronomy Clubs, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU)
**Course Facilitator of Mathematical Aspects of Relativity**  
*Duration: October 2023 - December 2023*

After completing my MSc, I undertook an initiative; designing, developing, and delivering a 30-hour course on Mathematical Aspects of Relativity to undergraduate students at PDEU. The course began with an overview of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. By applying these concepts, I aimed to teach principles such as the conservation of momentum and energy, along with derivations such as \(E=mc^2\), fostering a deeper understanding of Relativity concepts. The positive feedback received from students, expressing increased confidence in comprehending complex mathematical concepts, was truly encouraging.

### Office of International Relations, PDEU
**Course Facilitator & Teacher of Foundations of Mathematics**  
*Duration: December 2019 - March 2020*

For PDEU's Office of International Relations, I developed instructional material focused on reinforcing foundational mathematics skills and taught twelve international engineering students. Through innovative pedagogical methods, including real-world examples and visualization techniques, I aimed to enhance their understanding of key mathematics fundamentals. The motivational feedback received from students and the Head of Department, Mathematics, affirmed the effectiveness of the teaching approach.

### Yusuf Mehrally Centre (NGO), Kutch
**Teacher of Science & Mathematics**  
*Duration: December 2018 - January 2019*

During my internship at the Yusuf Mehrally Centre, I undertook the initiative to teach Mathematics and Science to underprivileged 8th-grade students in the absence of a full-time teacher. Tailoring teaching methods to meet the needs of students with special learning requirements, I incorporated real-world examples into interactive lessons. Despite challenging circumstances faced by the students, I demonstrated adaptability and dedication, resulting in a significant increase in exam pass rates.
