### Cardinal Hume Centre, London
**Homework Club Volunteer (Primariliy Mathematics and Science)**  
*Duration: May 2024 - Present*

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
Being passionate about education and empowering students, I am committed to providing personalised support that enhances their learning experiences. At [Cardinal Hume Centre](https://www.cardinalhumecentre.org.uk/), I offer dedicated assistance, one-to one as well as in group, with homework and exam preparation - fostering both confidence and understanding in my students. My teaching encompasses a range of mathematical concepts, including Geometry and Probability, specifically tailored for students up to GCSE level. Furthermore, I prioritise the development of young people's literacy and numeracy skills, ensuring that learning is engaging, relevant, and enjoyable.

### Mathematics and Astronomy Clubs, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU)
**Course Facilitator of Mathematical Aspects of Relativity**  
*Duration: October 2023 - December 2023*

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
After completing my MSc, I undertook an initiative; designing, developing, and delivering a 30-hour course on Mathematical Aspects of Relativity to undergraduate students at PDEU. The course began with an overview of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. By applying these concepts, I aimed to teach principles such as the conservation of momentum and energy, along with derivations such as \(E=mc^2\), fostering a deeper understanding of Relativity concepts. The positive feedback received from students, expressing increased confidence in comprehending complex mathematical concepts, was truly encouraging.

### Office of International Relations, PDEU
**Course Facilitator & Teacher of Foundations of Mathematics**  
*Duration: December 2019 - March 2020*

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
For PDEU's Office of International Relations, I developed instructional material focused on reinforcing foundational mathematics skills and taught twelve international engineering students. Through innovative pedagogical methods, including real-world examples and visualization techniques, I aimed to enhance their understanding of key mathematics fundamentals. The motivational feedback received from students and the Head of Department, Mathematics, affirmed the effectiveness of the teaching approach.

### Yusuf Mehrally Centre (NGO), Kutch
**Teacher of Science & Mathematics**  
*Duration: December 2018 - January 2019*

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
During my internship at the Yusuf Mehrally Centre, I undertook the initiative to teach Mathematics and Science to underprivileged 8th-grade students in the absence of a full-time teacher. Tailoring teaching methods to meet the needs of students with special learning requirements, I incorporated real-world examples into interactive lessons. Despite challenging circumstances faced by the students, I demonstrated adaptability and dedication, resulting in a significant increase in exam pass rates.
